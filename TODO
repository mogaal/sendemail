Reported Bugs:
    [ ] But it seems that I can't send more than 16 or 17 KB from the STDIN on Windows (2003) with the EXE version.
        Even with -o message-file=... and got the same 17 KB message limitation.

Feature Ideas
    [ ] A preferences file with default settings?
    [X] Deliver directly to MX server for domain?
    [ ] Command line option requesting read-receipt
        X-Confirm-Reading-To:
        Disposition-Notification-To: <user@domain.com>
        Return-Receipt-To:
    [ ] Add support for CRAM-MD5 authentication
    [ ] Add a pair of options to add receipt on delivery and on read of sent emails
    [ ] Support for unicode (european) characters in the subject

More Ideas:
    [ ] What about an option to send the same message more than once?
    [ ] How about a delay before sending the message?
    [ ] What about an internal queue for messages that wern't sent?
        Next time it's invoked it could deliver those messages as well.
    [ ] Convert inline documentation to standard perldoc format?
    [ ] Support for pop before smtp?

Crazy Ideas (not so sure about):
    [ ] Preferences registry settings for the Windows .exe version?
        (several people have said No! use a flat file)
